Done：
1 Implement a web page based on the design prototype, you do NOT have to be “pixel perfect”. But we would recommend trying to meet 90% of the design at the same same screen size.

2. The site needs to fit to the different size of the user’s screen. Only large desktop and mobile design are provided.

 
3. Add to Cart button on hover colour changes, apply a 0.2 second transition to animate this (desktop screen 3)
 
4. Mini Cart section (top right)
